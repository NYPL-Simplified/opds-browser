## Changelog

### v0.0.2
- Temporarily removing the `nypl-simplified-webpub-viewer` (version 0.0.4) package from the build. Install it locally `"nypl-simplified-webpub-viewer": "0.0.4"` in this `server` folder's `package.json` file to be able to read ebooks using the web reader. Temporarily removing it because a dependency is causing a build failure and the web reader package is not currently being maintained.
